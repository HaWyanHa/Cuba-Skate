		<h2 class="title">Our History</h2>
		<p>Cuba Skate was started by Lauren Bradley and Miles Jackson, two University of Michigan graduates who participated in a study abroad program in Havana, Cuba. In addition to their time in the classroom and touring the country’s provinces, much of their most influential time was spent with a group of Cuban skate friends. Every day they got to know this group of Cubans on a very personal level, giving them the opportunity to grow as friends and ultimately as an extended family. A key element of this close relationship was a shared passion for skateboarding. This international culture and sport molded Lauren, Miles and these Cuban skaters into a tight unit.</p>
